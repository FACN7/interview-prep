A collection of questions, exercises and resources to help students prepare for interviews

## Where to find jobs
Useful websites to search:
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/junior-developer-jobs/?originalSubdomain=il)
- [GlassDoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/israel-junior-web-developer-jobs-SRCH_IL.0,6_IN119_KO7,27.htm)
- [Indeed](https://il.indeed.com/Junior-Web-Developer-jobs)
- [Facebook no-experience Developer group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/no.experience/)
- Obvious advice, but make sure you try googling 'Junior Web Developer jobs in Israel', and go through the first few pages of results. New websites and listings pop up all the time!
- Search for tech companies you like, go on their websites and look for the **Jobs** sections (usually at the bottom of the page). Here they often list any open positions.

## Phone interview advice
If they ask you upfront about salary:
- Try to have done some research beforehand about the company and how much they pay. This information is often available - just try Googling
- Turn the question back on them - ask how much they typically pay junior developers? ask if you can give them an answer after you've met them and done an interview (you can say your salary expectations will be in industry standard range for a junior developer)
- If you have to give a number - According to Shireen, the industry standard is 14-16k, or 12-14k for smaller companies. Never go lower than 11k. Also make sure you talk to Shireen and Dana for advice when negotiating a salary.
